# Covid-19-Patient-s-Pre-Condition-Analysis
A health crisis of massive proportion such as the current COVID-9 pandemic provides us with an opportunity to ponder and reflect over what we can better in the way we deal with healthcare to make us humans be more prepared and enabled to combat such an event in the future. During the entire course of the pandemic, one of the main problems that healthcare providers have faced is the shortage of medical resources and a proper plan to efficiently distribute them. They have been in the dark failing to understand how much resource they could even in the very next week as the COVID-19 curve has swayed very unpredictably. In these tough times, being able to predict what kind of resource an individual might require at the time of being tested positive or even before that will be of great help to the authorities as they would be able to procure and arrange for the resources necessary to save the life of that patient.
